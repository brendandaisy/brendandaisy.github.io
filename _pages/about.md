Currently I am a postdoc in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics department at the University of Georgia, where I am working in the lab of [Spencer Fox](https://spncrfx.wordpress.com/).
My research involves combining mechanistic modeling and Bayesian statistics for the study of epidemiology and ecology. 
I'm particularly interested in using these tools for informing how data should be collected and for assessing control options from an information-theoretic perspective. Download my CV [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/pdf/cv-mar-2024.pdf).

I recently completed a PhD in Computer Science at the University of Vermont, co-advised by [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/) and [Jean-Gabriel Young](https://www.jgyoung.ca/).
Before coming to UVM, I obtained an MRes. degree in Natural Computation at the University of Birmingham, where I studied theoretical runtime analysis of Evolutionary Algorithms, and recieved a B.A. in Mathematics at Oberlin College.

My hobbies are running 🏃‍♀️, cooking 👩‍🍳, and eating 🍽. I love all things outdoors and spending time with my two dogs, Sammie and Dot.
