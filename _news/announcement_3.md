I am away from UVM this summer for an NIH T35 internship with the Big Data Health Science Center at the University of South Carolina! I will also be working with [Melissa Nolan](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/public_health/faculty-staff/nolan_melissa.php) to analyze the results of an ongoing survey of South Carolina ticks.
